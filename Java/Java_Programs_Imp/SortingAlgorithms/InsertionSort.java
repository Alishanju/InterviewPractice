//sorts array in place in ascending order ,if u need to chosse b/w bubble and insertion sort,
//better than bubble sort as it requires fewer swaps than bubble sort
/*ðŸ”¥ Which is Best?

Insertion Sort â†’ Best choice among the three (fastest in practice, adaptive, stable). -> VERY GOOD FOR SMALL/NEARLY SORTED ARRAYS(O(n))

Selection Sort â†’ Useful if swaps are more expensive than comparisons.

Bubble Sort â†’ Almost never best, only for learning. */
/*
 * Time complexity: O(n^2)
Space complexity:O(1)
